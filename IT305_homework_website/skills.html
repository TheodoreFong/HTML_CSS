							There are always those who admire others for what they can do, but you know what! Now you can be the one admired! The following skills are some of the unique things that every student could learn to become a more talented individual. It’ll take time to learn these skills, but the value is priceless.

							<br />
							<br />
							Learn How To Dance
<br />
							No, not the way people dance drunk at the clubs or grinding up on another person. I mean hip hop, breakdancing, doing the Dougie. Anyone that can freestyle or dance on the fly looks awesome when they’re breaking it down in the middle of a party.

							<br />
							<br />
							Be able to Play guitar (Singing with that is a plus)
							<br />
							There is something mesmerizing about the melodies from those six strings on a guitar. Anyone who picks up a guitar is instantly labeled as someone with soul. They can create something pleasing to the ears and many will stand in jealousy.

							<br />
							<br />
							Be an artist
<br />
							Not the most sought out skill, but it is always appreciated. Those with artistic abilities, or really, those who put the effort to draw anything and call it art are greatly appreciated in today’s society. There is something about our childhood past; maybe scarring memories of not being able to stay in the lines of the Fill-It-Yourself sketchbooks caused us to run away from art. Nonetheless, the average person will always admire those who can draw a decent picture.

							<br />
							<br />
							Write Poetry
<br />
							A writing career in poetry might not go very far, but a side hobby in creating poems will assist anyone’s career. Not only does it help you express yourself, those who write poetry are unique. They can turn simple words to have new meanings. 

							<br />
							<br />
							Be the typical Nerd and study beyond the amounts to get simply an A<br />
You know who they are. There really isn’t any more to be said.

<br />
							<br />
							Be a tech geek
<br />
							They know everything about technology. You think their annoying until your computer breaks and then they become your knights in shining armor.

							<br />
							<br />
							BeatBox and/or Rap
<br />
							Not that this is a useful skill for any practical applications, yet somehow at every social setting, there is always someone that can beatbox or rap and everyone is like ‘DANGGGGGGG!”

							<br />
							<br />
							Photography
<br />
							They know all about lighting and cameras, but what you really care about is making sure they capture the photo of you with your friends so you can save the memory for the rest of your life. It’s not hard to be a good photographer. The only requirements is an interest to make art out of our every day lives.

							<br />
							<br />
							Video Producer
<br />
							These people just have an idea. They get other people involve and then they make it happen! It is not hard to do if you can find people to help you out as actors. Once you make just one movie, you will look artistic and more sophisticated.
