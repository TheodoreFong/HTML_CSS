    <h1> Grad School Sleep and Working Out</h1>
    <p>I record my sleep every night and whenever I work out. For the purpose of this graph, I took the past 30 days of my sleep data from my Apple Watch and a binary "Yes" or "No" if I worked out.</p>
    <div id="chart"></div>
    <p> This plot shows the hours of sleep I had every night, with green indicating if I worked out that day and red indicating if I did not work out that day.</p>
    <p> Grad school is definitely taking a toll on me given the amount of sleep that I'm getting and how it seems to be related to my workout days.</p>
