<p>I record my sleep every night and whenever I work out. For the purpose of this graph, I took the past 30 days of my sleep data from my Apple Watch and a binary "Yes" or "No" if I worked out.</p>

<div id="title">Sleeping and Workout Out while in Grad School</div>

<p> This plot shows the hours of sleep I had every night, with green indicating if I worked out that day and red indicating if I did not work out that day.</p>
<p> Grad school is definitely taking a toll on me given the amount of sleep that I'm getting and how it seems to be related to my workout days.</p>
