							When I accepted my appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY, I did not honestly know what to expect.
							 Caught in the media trap, I thought I was getting myself into what the real Army was all about. You know, Blackhawk Down and Kelly’s
							  Heroes, right? For the first couple weeks of my Cadet Basic Training, I sure was in for a surprise. 
							<br />
							<br />
							Cadet Basic Training started a week after my graduation from Mission San Jose High School in 2010. It was probably one of the biggest 
							shocks of my life. I realized that I just joined the military! The most glorified profession of arms for the glory of battle, a dangerous
							 profession, but an honorable service. But what did that even mean? I had no idea, because I honestly did not realize what I was getting 
							 myself into when I showed up to West Point. I was the first in my family to join the military and my parents were equally puzzled by my 
							 decision. It took a while, but after the long summer days of training, I started to realize what serving your country really means. 
							<br />
							<br />
							The reason why I was just grasping this concept now was because I was a mess before coming to West Point. I think that everyone can agree
							 with me that in high school, your morals and priorities are never really straight. After all, no one is going to know if I break some 
							 rules a couple times, right? In high school we were told to find our identities and discover who we are, because your next and maybe last
							  chance to recreate your identity is in college. What they didn’t tell us though is to develop our character. Our character is something 
							  that cannot change easily, because it is a direct reflection of our hearts. 
							<br />
							<br />
							Two years later finishing my second year at the academy, I had matured and grown far more than most people would have ever imagined. 
							Whether it is the regimented lifestyle or the greater demands on a cadet, I noticed that the way I thought, my character, has changed to 
							become more honorable. I have two years left to become the best person I can possibly be, so when I become an Officer, I can properly serve
							 those around me. 
<br />
							<br />
							Today, I will be doing an affirmation to my commitment to finish my next two years of study, serve five years active duty, and at least 
							three years of reserves. Cadets that don’t want to make this affirmation usually quit before this ceremony. Although some of my friends 
							chose to quit, those of us that chose to stay are really excited to serve our country. With us, there are those stereotypical Hollywood 
							soldiers with countless amazing talents to offer. However, some of us are just goofballs, or not athletic, or not really that bright, 
							while some of us struggle with just the basic military skills. Despite our differences in strengths, we are all members of a team with a 
							common desire to want to serve our country. 
<br />
							<br />
							Many US citizens openly support the military even though they don’t really know what we do. If it is too much to ask you to get to know
							 what the military actually does (besides fighting), I ask you to at least to remember that we are humans too. We all love, we all cry 
							 (well, maybe not all), we are all just normal humans just like you. Several times while wearing my uniform, people have stared at me as
							  if I am some crazy brutal soldier. Nope, I’m just Teddy. As I think about the affirmation today, I still don’t really feel like the 
							  soldier that Hollywood makes the military look out to be. I feel like a random guy that responded to the call to serve our country as 
							  a soldier.
